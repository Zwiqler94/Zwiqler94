- 👋 Hi, I’m Jake
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber Security
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in the CyberSec realm!

As a skilled developer, I specialize in creating web apps, microservices, and RESTful APIs using Node.js, Express.js, and Angular with IBM Carbon Design System and Angular Material. With a focus on Test-Driven Development, I use Mocha, Chai, Jest, and Supertest to create robust unit tests for both front-end and back-end interfaces, and write OpenAPI 3 documentation for APIs.

I currently work at IBM, where I had the opportunity to work on the New York State Excelsior Pass project, the first COVID-19 vaccine passport designed for NY State, digital credentialing network utilizing SMART Health Cards, decentralized identity, and blockchain technology.

I am skilled in using Git, Jenkins, Jira, and Travis CI for managing the development lifecycle in an Agile environment. I have experience with SQL and NoSQL databases, including Postgres and MongoDB, and am knowledgeable in using Docker and Kubernetes to manage and deploy applications in the cloud. I have worked with various cloud platforms, including IBM Cloud and Google Cloud Platform.

In addition to my technical skills, I have experience mentoring junior developers and identifying bottlenecks in existing processes to help build tools and solutions for delivering faster results to clients.

All opinions and ideas here are never on the behalf of my employer, IBM.
